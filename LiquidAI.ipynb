            "Liquid AI’s models are large language models that excel at reasoning, coding, and handling complex tasks, making them powerful for AI applications. Which use case interests you most?<|text_end|>Yes, you can run the Liquid AI models on standard CPUs, though they may be slower and use less memory than GPU‑accelerated versions. If you need faster inference, you could look at quantized versions or run them on cloud services that support CPU workloads. Would you like tips on how to optimize them for CPU?<|text_end|>I understand the issue can be frustrating. You can try running the models on a CPU with a GPU if you have one, or use a cloud service that offers a free tier with a modest GPU. Another option is to use a model that is already quantized for lower precision, which can run faster on standard hardware. Would you like guidance on setting up a free cloud instance or a CPU with a GPU?<|text_end|>I’m glad you’re giving it a try! If you run into any issues, just let me know and I can walk you through the next steps.<|text_end|>"
