Audio chat with Liquid AI

That's a small and simple example of audio conversation with a Liquid AI model.
Before running it, make sure to install the proper packages with the terminal, you can find them in the "Packages" repository.
You can already find three audio examples in the "Example Audio" repository, but you can change them as you wish with other files.
I suggest running this application with Google Colab with GPU runtime activated (or with a device with an Nvidia GPU mounted) as I encountered difficulties trying running it on a device without CUDA cores.
