# LiquidAI
Audio chat with Liquid AI.

That's a small and simple example of audio conversation with a Liquid AI model, you can find the Python code in the "Liquid_AI" file.
Before running it, make sure to install the proper packages with the terminal, you can find them in the "Packages" file.
You can already find three audio examples in the "Liquid_Q&A" file, they're already written in the code and you just need to fix it with the right path, but you can change them as you wish with other files.
I suggest running this application with Google Colab with GPU runtime activated (or with a device with an Nvidia GPU mounted) as I encountered difficulties trying running it on a device without CUDA cores.
